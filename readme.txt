# Chatbot

## What is this

This is a fully functional conversational agent that has been trained on a huge database of movie lines to give responses

## Why I built this

One of my first deployed projects in the realm of ML - I wanted to put myself in this environment to feel comfortable to branch out to more complex applications with business use cases. 

## How this was built

Trained an LSTM using Keras, used NLTK to preprocess all of the relevant training data

## How to run

Download weights file from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uMw-7EHsasbiaANAjjAuGSg7F95_wq7X

With all the files in one directory (weights and all the files in the repository) , run the command:

python chatbot.py

## Dependencies

Keras and NLTK

Will take a while to run
